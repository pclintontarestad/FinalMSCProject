    "## Cell 2 — Global Simulation Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell defines all physical and numerical parameters used throughout the tripod-memory simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Architecture\n",
    "The Hamiltonian and master equation follow the rotating-frame tripod structure:  \n",
    "∣e⟩ ↔ {∣g₋₁⟩, ∣g₀⟩, ∣g₊₁⟩}.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The parameters defined here specify:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Physical constants**  \n",
    "   - Excited-state decay rate: Γₑ = 2π × 6.07 rad/μs  \n",
    "   - Ground-state dephasing set to zero (idealised limit).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Detunings**  \n",
    "   All three ground states share independently configurable detunings δ₋₁, δ₀, δ₊₁.  \n",
    "   In a true Λ-type memory these could generate differential phase evolution between probe channels — here they allow us to test whether any combination of splittings can restore dark-manifold dimensionality (**it does not**).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temporal structure**  \n",
    "   The simulation window is partitioned into:  \n",
    "   - **WRITE** interval: 0 ≤ t ≤ T_write  \n",
    "   - **GATE** interval (control off)  \n",
    "   - **READ** interval for retrieval  \n",
    "   Time resolution is set by `N_steps` to ensure numerical smoothness of dark-projector derivatives and gap diagnostics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pulse amplitudes and envelopes**  \n",
    "   The Gaussian envelopes for probe and control pulses are defined via:  \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\Omega(t) = A \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(t - t_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right].\n",
    "   $$  \n",
    "   These parameters determine the adiabatic accessibility of the dark subspace.  \n",
    "   **Under Option C, the critical fact is:**  \n",
    "   No choice of pulse envelope or amplitude can turn the rank-1 tripod channel into a rank-2 channel unless new coupling degrees of freedom are added (as in dual-Λ).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Clebsch–Gordan coefficients**  \n",
    "   The CGCs $C_{-1}, C_{0}, C_{+1}$ govern emission branching and — more importantly — the structure of the bright state:  \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   |B(t)\\rangle \\propto \\Omega_{-1}(t)|g_{-1}\\rangle + \\Omega_{0}(t)|g_{0}\\rangle + \\Omega_{+1}(t)|g_{+1}\\rangle.\n",
    "   $$  \n",
    "   Varying CGCs is one of the diagnostics we later sweep over to confirm that:  \n",
    "   - the bright vector remains 1-dimensional,  \n",
    "   - therefore the orthogonal dark subspace remains 2-dimensional,  \n",
    "   - and because **only one dark direction is dynamically reachable**,  \n",
    "     the effective channel is **rank-1 for all parameter settings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Basis indexing**  \n",
    "   Defines the mapping between integer indices and physical states to keep all later blocks (e.g., dark projector, SU(3) expansion, Bloch reductions) consistent."

    "   $p_{\\text{dark}} \\approx 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad$ good adiabatic transfer into the DFS.\n",

    "2. **Does the dark manifold faithfully encode the qubit, or does it collapse everything onto a single direction?**  \n",
    "   - If $p_{\\text{dark}}$ is high **but** $F_{\\text{dark}}$ is close to 1 **only for one special input** and low for others →  \n",
    "     the dark manifold acts as a **projector onto one preferred dark mode** → **rank-1 channel even inside the DFS**.  \n",
    "   - (Hypothetically) If we ever saw $p_{\\text{dark}} \\approx 1$ **and** $F_{\\text{dark}} \\approx 1$ for many inputs → genuine isometric SU(2) storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our baseline single-control tripod:  \n",
    "- $p_{\\text{dark}} \\approx 0.97–0.99$: excellent adiabatic storage into the dark manifold.  \n",
    "- **But** fidelity and Bloch diagnostics show the reachable part of this dark manifold is **effectively 1D** from the input’s perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This cell is the core evidence that:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> “The single-control tripod is not just ‘inefficient’ — it is **fundamentally non-isometric** as a qubit memory, **even when judged in its own correct dark-state basis**.”\n",
    "\n",
    "That is precisely the starting point for **Option C**: treat this non-isometric, rank-deficient encoding as a **feature to be modeled** (via an induced metric) rather than a bug to be fixed."

    "- identifying dark eigenstates via tiny $|e\\rangle$-component,\n",
    "- restricting to the ground manifold,\n",
    "- using it to compute dark support, adiabaticity, etc.\n",

    "- You can verify whether there are 0, 1, or 2 “good” dark eigenstates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **single-tripod baseline**, you typically observe:\n",
    "- **One** eigenvector with nearly all weight in $|e\\rangle$ → bright state,\n",
    "- **Two** eigenvectors with $|\\langle e | E_m \\rangle|^2 \\lesssim 10^{-10}$ → mathematically dark,\n",
    "- But (as shown by previous diagnostics) **only one** of these dark eigenstates is dynamically populated from $|g_0\\rangle$ under the given pulses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fully consistent with the **effective rank-1 channel** diagnosed elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. How This Supports the “No Hidden Second Dark Mode” Claim\n",
    "\n",
    "When you later run the **parameter-sweep cell** (varying CGCs, relative phases, detunings, pulse shapes, etc.), you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Re-run this instantaneous eigen-analysis for every parameter point,\n",
